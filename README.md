# 🔍 Gate Level Perceptron
- A 4×4 configurable digital logic circuit for **pattern recognition**.
- This is my attempt to understand how machines can detect patterns on a 4×4 binary grid correctly and precisely from the bottom up from logic gates.

## 🧱 Versions Built
- [Detector_v0.0](Detector_v0.0) -> Recognizes the pattern and sub-patterns of the weighted-pattern.

## 🔜 Future Versions
- More precise detection, ensuring only the intented pattern with weights is only recognized, not the sub-patterns
- Adding numerical weights to the weight array for more control and programmability.
