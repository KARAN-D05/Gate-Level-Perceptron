# 🔍 Gate Level Perceptron
- A 4×4 configurable digital logic circuit for **pattern recognition**.
- This is my attempt to understand how machines can detect patterns on a 4×4 binary grid correctly and precisely from the bottom up from logic gates.

## 🧱 Versions Built
- [Detector_v0.0](Detector_v0.0) -> Recognizes the pattern and sub-patterns if they are in boundary set up by weights-grid.
- [Detector v0.1](Detector_v0.1) -> Recognizes only the selected pattern on the weight-grid.

## 🔜 Future Versions
- Popcount based judgement instead of perfect equivalence check.
